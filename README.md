# Customer Profitability & Action Optimization Engine

A customer-level economic decision engine for a **synthetic neobank**,
combining profitability accounting, Funds Transfer Pricing, credit risk,
econometrics, machine learning, Customer Lifetime Value, simulation, and
mathematical optimization to determine where customer value comes from and
how a bank can allocate limited resources to maximize incremental economic
profit.

Full specification: [`PROJECT_SPEC.md`](PROJECT_SPEC.md).

> **Status: Phase 0 (project setup), Phase 1 (synthetic data generation) and
> Phase 2 (data quality engine) are complete.** Everything from Phase 3
> onward (Customer 360, profitability engine, econometrics, ML, CLV,
> segmentation, action simulation, optimization, dashboard) is not yet
> implemented. This README will be replaced by the full portfolio-quality
> version in Phase 18, once those results actually exist — nothing below is
> a business finding, only a description of what runs today.

## What exists today

- A month-by-month synthetic data simulation for 20,000 customers over 36
  months (`src/customer_profitability/data/generator.py`), producing
  `customers`, `accounts`, `deposits`, `cards`, `loans`, `customer_service`,
  and `customer_monthly` parquet tables under `data/raw/`.
- Deliberately realistic correlation structure (income ↔ age ↔ segment ↔
  balances ↔ credit limits), a documented multi-factor churn hazard, and
  deliberately injected missing values / duplicate rows for the Phase 2 data
  quality engine to catch. See [`data/README.md`](data/README.md) for full
  generation and churn-mechanism documentation.
- A Phase 2 Data Quality Engine (`src/customer_profitability/data/quality.py`)
  running structural, missingness (expected/suspicious/critical),
  duplicate, financial-validity, temporal-consistency, and
  referential-integrity checks on every raw table. It never silently drops a
  row: every table is split into `data/processed/<table>_validated.parquet`
  and `data/processed/<table>_quarantined.parquet`, and a scored report is
  written to `reports/data_quality_report.{md,json}`.
- 22 passing unit tests (`tests/test_data_generation.py`,
  `tests/test_data_quality.py`) covering reproducibility, financial
  validity, temporal/referential integrity, correlation structure, and every
  quality-engine check against hand-crafted defective rows.

## Reproducibility

```bash
make install         # uv sync
make generate-data    # regenerate data/raw/*.parquet (seed 42)
make quality           # run the data quality engine -> data/processed/, reports/
make test              # run the test suite
```

Everything is seeded (`seed: 42` in `config/settings.yaml`); rerunning
`make generate-data` reproduces byte-identical output.

## Architecture (target, per `PROJECT_SPEC.md`)

```text
SYNTHETIC RAW DATA → DATA QUALITY → CUSTOMER 360
   → HISTORICAL PROFITABILITY + BEHAVIORAL FEATURES/ML
   → FUTURE PROFITABILITY → CLV → ECONOMIC SEGMENTATION
   → ACTION SIMULATION → OPTIMIZATION ENGINE
   → RECOMMENDED ACTIONS → STREAMLIT APP
```

## Repository structure

See `PROJECT_SPEC.md` §7 for the full target layout. Implemented so far:
`config/`, `data/`, `reports/`, `src/customer_profitability/{data,utils}/`, `tests/`.

## Tech stack

Python, pandas, NumPy, DuckDB, PyArrow, statsmodels, SciPy, scikit-learn,
XGBoost, SHAP, OR-Tools, Plotly, Matplotlib, Streamlit, pytest, uv.
